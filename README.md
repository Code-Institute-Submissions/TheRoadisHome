 # User Experience (UX)

## Project Research
Over the past few years I have travelled with various group tours and have used a couple of different companies. This has given me a good understanding of what a customer looks for in a travel company and what they expect to find on their website.

## The Customer
- The ideal customer of the website is someone who is looking for a style of travel that benefits both the traveller and the places they visit.
- They want to travel in a way that is responsible and sustainable.
- They are looking to travel with others that have similar interests.
- They want the flexibility to choose a trip with a cost and duration that suits them.
- They are looking for a service that provides them with support and takes away the stress and time involved in planning a trip.

## User goals

As a user visiting the website, I want:

- to be able to navigate it easily
- to understand the purpose
- to know about the company's ethos
- to find out what tours are available
- to find out the costs involved
- to view images that would inspire me
- to be able to contact the company
- to be able to access the company's social media accounts.

## Business goals

As a business owner, I want:

- to sell group tours
- to offer a platform for users to see what tours are on offer
- to provide an online presence for the company
- to update/create/delete tours as needed
- to enable users to contact the company with any queries
- to share images from past customers to create connections and inspire users.


# Design

I wanted the design of the website to be relatively simple, with a modern look which appeals to adults in the 20-40 age range.

## Colours

I decided that the main colour scheme would be grey, black and white with accents of coral.

- COOLERS PALLETTE

I wanted the bright coral to provide some warmth and contrast to the otherwise quite subtle colours. I have used it as the colour of the footer, the icons and the headings on the 'About' page.

## Fonts

I have decided on the fonts 'Raleway' for headings and 'Montserrat' for the body text which were both found on Google Fonts. They are simple, sans-serif typefaces which are easy to read, accessible and are not distracting to the user.
