User Experience (UX)

Project Research
Over the past few years I have travelled with various group tours and have used a couple of different companies. This has given me a good understanding of what a customer looks for in a travel company and what they expect to find on their website.

The Customer
The ideal customer of the website is someone who is looking for a style of travel that benefits both the traveller and the places they visit.
They want to travel in a way that is responsible and sustainable.
They are looking to travel with others that have similar interests.
They want the flexibility to choose a trip with a cost and duration that suits them.
They are looking for a service that provides them with support and takes away the stress and time involved in planning a trip.
