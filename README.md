 # User Experience (UX)

## Project Research
Over the past few years I have travelled with various group tours and have used a couple of different companies. This has given me a good understanding of what a customer looks for in a travel company and what they expect to find on their website.

## The Customer
- The ideal customer of the website is someone who is looking for a style of travel that benefits both the traveller and the places they visit.
- They want to travel in a way that is responsible and sustainable.
- They are looking to travel with others that have similar interests.
- They want the flexibility to choose a trip with a cost and duration that suits them.
- They are looking for a service that provides them with support and takes away the stress and time involved in planning a trip.

## User goals

As a user visiting the website, I want:

- to be able to navigate it easily
- to understand the purpose
- to know about the company's ethos
- to find out what tours are available
- to find out the costs involved
- to view images that would inspire me
- to be able to contact the company
- to be able to access the company's social media accounts.

## Business goals

As a business owner, I want:

- to sell group tours
- to offer a platform for users to see what tours are on offer
- to provide an online presence for the company
- to update/create/delete tours as needed
- to enable users to contact the company with any queries
- to share images from past customers to create connections and inspire users.


# Design

I wanted the design of the website to be relatively simple, with a modern look which appeals to adults in the 20-40 age range.

- ## Colours

I decided that the main colour scheme would be grey, black and white with accents of coral.

- COOLERS PALLETTE

I wanted the bright coral to provide some warmth and contrast to the otherwise quite subtle colours. I have used it as the colour of the footer, the icons and the headings on the 'About' page.

- ## Fonts

I have decided on the fonts 'Raleway' for headings and 'Montserrat' for the body text which were both found on Google Fonts. They are simple, sans-serif typefaces which are easy to read, accessible and are not distracting to the user.

- ## Styling

I used icons from FontAwesome as links to social media in the footer and also as imagery on the 'Home' and 'About' pages.
I gave the text in the 'read more' buttons a shadow effect as well as the tour card boxes which gives the user a sense of interaction when they hover over them.

- ## Imagery

All images on the site were taken or drawn by myself. I chose colourful and eyecatching photos for the homepage which will draw the user's attention to them. I made the gallery images into circles by changing the border radius which I think gives them a slightly unusual look and makes them stand out.
<br>
I drew the maps and routes of the tours using ProCreate on my iPad. I gave the backgrounds a muted, pastel colour and the place names were handwritten, with the aim of giving the user a sense of a personal relationship with the company.

- ## Layout

I chose to design a multi-page website as I feel it is easier to navigate, as it is more familiar and predictable to the average user. Although I have made the website responsive on various device sizes, I think most people when looking to make a costly purchase, such as a holiday, they would use a larger device e.g. a laptop, which a multi-page site works very well on.

# Features

## Existing features


- Present on each page is:


  - Navbar - This displays the 4 pages of the website: Home, Tours, About and Contact. The current page the user is on is underline so they always know where they are. On a desktop, the links are displayed horizontally at the top right of the page and when on a mobile/tablet, a 'hamburger' dropdown menu appears instead.

  - Logo - At the top left of each page is the company logo which takes the user to the homepage when clicked.

  - Footer - This contains links to social media accounts which open in a new tab. The background colour is coral which stands out against the white background of each page.

- Homepage

  - Hero image

      - The heading of 'Local and Worldwide Adventures' makes it immediately apparent what the website is for, when the user first enters.
  
      - This is always 100% width of the screen.
  
      - The 'read more' button takes the user to the 'About' page which tells them all about the company. I added a coral text shadow to the button so when hovered over, it stands out against the background.
  
      - The hero image has a 3 second zoom effect upon loading, which I learnt how to do from the Love Running project.

  - Popular tours 

      - This instantly lets the user know the sort of tours that are available.

      - The 3 cards are displayed horizontally and switch to vertical on mobile displays.

      - The buttons link to the 'Tours' page where the user can find more information.

  - Why Choose Us?

      - This section lets the user know what to expect with the tours we provide.
    
      - The text is displayed around the image and toggles to vertical on smaller screens.

      - On mobile devices, the image disappears.

      - The grey background helps break up the homepage into sections.

  - Gallery

      - The photos are shown in a grid of x4 columns on desktop and x2 columns on tablets/mobiles.

- Tours
  - This page features a Bootstrap grid of 6 cards of the tours that are available. The cards switch to a column of 1 when displayed on a mobile screen which allows the user to see the maps and text clearly.

  - There is a link to the contact form at the bottom of the page which lets the user enquire about bookings.

- About
  - I wanted to keep this page simple so users can see the company's ethos and values at a glance.

  - I added a link to a PDF document containing the routes of the available tours which users can download if they wish.

- Contact
  - This page contains a 'contact us' form which allows the user to contact the company with any queries and it also allows them to subscribe to the newsletter.

  - On larger devices, the contact form appears in the centre of the screen and on mobiles/tablets, the form size increases to the width of the device.

  - After submitting, the user is directed to the Code Institute server which lets them know their query has been submitted.

- 404
  - In the footer, alongside the links to social media, I have added a lightning bolt icon which takes the user to a sample 404 error page.

  - A button under the error message takes the user back to the homepage.

## Future features to implement

- a page of positive customer reviews/feedback
- ability for customers to book tours online
- customer accounts - allow users to log in and view their booking information
- a section/page that connects the company's Instagram and automatically displays the latest images posted
- a page with more information on responsible travel and overtourism
- a search box for users to find what they're looking for quickly
- blog section that travellers can contribute to
- a 'thank you' message that appears when the contact form has been submitted.

# Testing

## Validators

  - [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - I ran each page of the site through the validator and a few typos and stray /div tags were found. I amended these to remove the errors.

  - [W3C CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - No errors but a 'warning' that the button within the hero image had the same colour (black) for the background and the border. As this was intentional (the background becomes transparent when hovered over) I chose to ignore this warning. 

## Lighthouse

    - The layout is sectioned and titled so it is easy to see where each one starts and ends.

2. As a user, I want to know what is being provided and what the values of the company are.

    - A user can find out about the company on the 'About Us' page and on this page there is a list of what is included with each tour.

    - A user can see the company's values on the homepage under 'Why Choose Us?'.

3. As a user, I want to know what tours are available and what the costs are.


    - Users can find maps of the tour routes along with the cost of the trips on the 'Tours' page.

    - Users can scroll to the bottom of the homepage to see a gallery of photographs from previous tours.

5. As a user, I want to view the company's social media accounts.

    - Users can access the social media links through the footer of any page of the website.

6. As a user, I want to be able to contact the company.
